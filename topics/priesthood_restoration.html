            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>As Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery worked on the Book of Mormon translation, they came 
                across a section that led them to wonder about God's priesthood authority. In 3 Nephi, 
                they learned about how Christ conferred authority to baptize on His selected disciples. 
                They wondered what implications this held for the modern day, and where the authority to 
                baptize had gone. Seeking answers to these questions, they went to the nearby 
                Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania to pray. As they prayed, they were visited by John the 
                baptist, who conferred on them the Aaronic priesthood, which he taught held the keys 
                of the ministering of angels, the gospel of repentance, and of baptism. After receiving 
                this authority, Joseph and Oliver baptized each other. <br><br> The restoration of the 
                Melchizedek priesthood and its keys, on the other hand, was not so much of a one time 
                event, and it could be said that it is still ongoing as there are keys remaining to be 
                restored to the earth. Though the exact time and place is not known, sometime several 
                months after the restoration of the Aaronic priesthood, Joseph and Oliver were visited 
                by Peter, James, and John, who conferred upon them the Melchizedek priesthood. Another 
                significant Melchizedek priesthood restoration event was in the Kirtland temple, where 
                Joseph and Oliver were visited by Moses, Elias, and Elijah, who gave restored the keys 
                of the gathering of Israel, the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham, and the sealing 
                power, respectively.<br><br>
