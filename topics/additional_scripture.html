            <hr>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Joseph's prophetic mission of bringing restored truths to the Saints through scripture 
                was not complete with the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. Early in his work, 
                Joseph was commanded of the Lord to commence a translation of the Bible. While Joseph's edits 
                are today known as the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, the term "translation" somewhat 
                inaccurately describes what actually happened. Joseph worked from an English Bible, and, 
                reading through verse by verse, sought the Lord's guidance on what the original meaning 
                and intent of the passage of scripture was. He tried his best to restore the contemporary 
                meaning of the scripture through additions, omissions, rephrasing, etc.<br><br> Part of the 
                standard works of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today is The Pearl of Great Price. 
                It is composed of the Book of Moses, the Book of Abraham, a portion of Joseph Smith's Bible translation 
                of Matthew, Joseph Smith - History, and the Articles of Faith. The Book of Moses came from Joseph 
                Smith's translation of the Bible in Genesis. Of particular interest and uniqueness is the Book of 
                Abraham.<br><br> The origins of the Book of Abraham deals with a man named Michael Chandler. Chandler 
                had acquired several ancient Egyptian antiquities, including mummies and papyri. In a visit to Kirtland, 
                he offered Joseph Smith some of the papyri and mummies, which Joseph bought. Upon investigating the 
                papyri, Joseph learned that they included records from the Old Testament prophet Abraham. He translated 
                the record and it is included in today's Pearl of Great Price. Some argue that the papyri Joseph worked 
                from had nothing to do with Abraham. Remaining bits of the papyri show an ancient funerary text. See 
                the Church's "Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham" below for more information on this.
