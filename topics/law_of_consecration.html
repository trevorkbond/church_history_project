            <h1><b>The Law of Consecration</b></h1>
            <hr>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Law of Consecration remains a confusing topic for many Latter-day Saints today. Some believe 
                that it was something the Lord tried to have the early Saints implement, but after the attempt 
                failed, the law was revoked and replaced with tithing. Other confusion comes from the different 
                practices that went along with the Law of Consecration in the early Church. However, modern 
                prophets have affirmed that the Law of Consecration has not been revoked and is still in 
                effect today. Church members who go through the temple covenant to obey the Law of Consecration. 
                So what does it mean for us to practice it today?<br><br>It is helpful to understand that consecration 
                was put in practice in various ways by early Saints. One of these is known as "all things common". This 
                practice involved Saints consecrating all of their possessions to the Church and being deeded back a 
                portion of it. This was described by the Lord in the Doctrine and Covenants (see D&C 51 below). Another 
                way the Saints implemented consecration was by means of the United Order. This was a business organization 
                put in place by the Church, the proceeds of which were go toward the building up of Zion. It is important to 
                know that the Law of Consecration was, while related to these implementations, ultimately a separate 
                commandment. Thus, the Church today is indeed living the law even though we do not practice "all things common".
