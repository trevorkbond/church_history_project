            <h1><b>Kirtland Revelations</b></h1>
            <hr>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Many of the Church's most significant historical events and doctrinally important revelations 
                came in Kirtland. The prophet Joseph Smith spent the majority of his adult life there and was 
                taught by the Lord in many ways as he worked on translations and sought His will. In Kirtland, 
                Joseph Smith received significant revelations revealing doctrine about the afterlife and the 
                Word of Wisdom, and he began to be instructed regarding the endowment.<br><br>While Joseph Smith 
                and Sidney Rigdon were working on the Bible translation, they came across John 5:29, which reads 
                "And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have 
                done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." Joseph and Sidney pondered about this partition of 
                humanity either to be submitted to eternal life or eternal damnation. As they were pondering on this, 
                they received several visions in which they saw God the Father and Jesus Christ, Lucifer and the sons 
                of perdition, and then the three kingdoms of glory, those being the celestial, terrestrial, and telestial 
                kingdoms. They learned that nearly all of God's children would be placed in a kingdom of glory eternally. 
                This was groundbreaking revelation and found an interesting middle ground between the idea of universal 
                salvation and the harsher idea of many being left to suffer eternally.<br><br>Another significant revelation 
                that took on more importance over time was the Word of Wisdom. Joseph Smith organized a School of the Prophets, 
                where he intended to prepare many of the Elders to be endowed with power or, in other words, be allowed to 
                see God. Many of the Elders smoked and chewed tobacco, leaving the upper room in the store they met in filthy. 
                Emma Smith, who helped clean this room, talked about this with Joseph, and he wondered whether this behavior was 
                appropriate for people preparing to be endowed. This led to the Lord revealing the Word of Wisdom, which 
                was first set forth not as a commandment, but was made such many years later after the Saints had traveled 
                to Utah.
