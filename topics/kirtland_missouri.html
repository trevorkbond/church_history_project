            <h1><b>Trouble in Kirtland & Missouri</b></h1>
            <hr>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Difficulties within the community of Saints and from individuals without began to abound in 
                Kirtland and Missouri. In the midst of his time in Kirtland, the prophet Joseph began receiving 
                revelations that the Lord was intending to gather His people to Zion, a physical location where 
                they could create a Zion community. It was eventually revealed that this gathering place was to be 
                Independence, Missouri. Joseph Smith and others visited, and the Church began purchasing land there. 
                Eventually a cornerstone for a future temple to be built in Independence was set. However, as Saints 
                began to gather to Missouri, locals began to feel increasingly threatened by there presence. A gathering 
                body of Saints meant drastic changes to their community. Importantly, locals also felt that the Saints 
                would have unfair political power and influence the local politics greatly. After a fight broke out 
                when Saints tried to vote in a local election, exaggerated reports of Saints being violent swept across 
                the state. As animosity for the Saints grew, they were told they had to leave Independence. The Saints 
                tried various ways to stay, and a group of soldiers called Zion's Camp was formed, but eventually, 
                they were forced out of Zion. Further animosity remaining in Missouri led to tragic events, some in which 
                the Saints fought back, such as the Battle of Crooked River, and some in which the Saints were 
                hunted by mobs, such as the Hawn's Mill Massacre. Eventually, Governer Lilburn Boggs signed an 
                order to "exterminate" the Saints.<br><br>While difficulties continued in Missouri, the prophet Joseph 
                was facing rejection by previously faithful Saints in Kirtland. One catalyst that led to many losing 
                faith in the prophet was the failure of a bank set up by him called the Kirtland Safety Society. This failure 
                was caused by several factors, including a nationwide financial panic and many individuals antagonistic to 
                the Saints making a "run on the bank" by storing up loads of the bank's notes and then attempting to cash 
                them all at once. This failure led many to question Joseph Smith's claims that he was led by the Lord. If 
                Joseph really were a true prophet, wouldn't the bank have been able to survive? The discrepancy seemed 
                too much for many to bear, and over time some of Joseph's close friends and many faithful Saints turned 
                against him.
