            <h1><b>Plural Marriage</b></h1>
            <hr>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Plural marriage remains a difficult topic of Church history for many to understand and reason with. 
                As we try to understand the early Church's practice of polygamy, it is important that we look to 
                good sources that instruct us in truthful ways. Essentially from the early beginnings of the Church, 
                many antagonistic individuals have sought to spread misinformation, exaggerated accounts, and 
                other falsehoods about the personal life of Joseph Smith and especially the practice of polygamy 
                by early Saints.<br><br>Joseph Smith wondered early on in the formation of the Church about prophets 
                in the Old Testament who were commanded to marry and have relations with multiple women, such as Abraham 
                and Jacob. The Lord instructed him regarding His law about marriage, and taught him that, at times, He will 
                command His people to live this law. D&C section 132 includes what the Lord taught Joseph about the 
                practice of plural marriage. In its section summary added later, it indicates that Joseph learned about 
                these principles beginning as early as 1831. Thus, we can see that Joseph Smith himself struggled mightily 
                the concept of plural marriage. It took time for him to understand the Lord's will and figure out how 
                he was going to help early Saints implement it.<br><br>In D&C 132, there are several reasons given for 
                why the Church began to practice plural marriage, including:
                <ol>
                    <li>The Lord commanded them to practice it.</li>
                    <li>Restoring the practice of polygamy was just a part of the entirety of the restoration of all things.</li>
                    <li>To raise up righteous seed among the Saints.</li>
                </ol>
                It is important to understand that we don't have contemporary records of the practice of plural marriage 
                in Nauvoo. Records seem to indicate that Joseph Smith's first plural marriage happened in Kirtland to a girl 
                named Fanny Alger. It is now estimated that Joseph Smith was involved in somewhere between 20 and 30 plural 
                marriages. In talking about these marriages, it is also important to understand that the Saints had a 
                different understanding of marriage than what we may typically think. As Joseph Smith learned about the 
                doctrine of celestial marriage, there came about the idea of a distinction between a marriage for "time" 
                and a marriage for "eternity". Many of the plural marriages performed were not performed for time and eternity. 
                Some were performed only to be binding in this life, while others were performed for eternity only, in that they 
                were to take effect after this life. The specifics of how relationships including plural marriages or remarriages 
                will be worked out in the eternities are ultimately unknown.<br><br>A final important note to make about plural 
                marriage is what it did for the Saints as a whole. Joseph Smith and the early Saints saw plural marriage as an 
                opportunity to bind themselves together through horizontal links. Today, we often thing of marriage in a vertical 
                sense - our family trees progress vertically with each new generation arising from a previous married couple. 
                However, Joseph Smith and the early Saints thought of these plural marriage sealings as dynastic. They presented 
                an opportunity to be able to live together in the Lord's presence in the eternities as a Zion community connected 
                by horizontal marriages. This idea becomes especially understandable when we learn that Joseph Smith had recently 
                learned that a celestial marriage was essential to return to God's presence, but he didn't yet have the doctrine 
                of proxy sealings. Many of the early Saints believed that their only chance to return to God's presence was through 
                a celestial plural marriage.
