            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Driven from Missouri and seeking refuge, the Saints fled to Missouri. They were met with warmth and 
                help from locals in a town called Quincy. Later, they were offered land in a town originally named 
                Commerce. The Saints purchased this land and renamed it Nauvoo, meaning the "beautiful city". Nauvoo 
                saw eventual prosperity and many significant developments in Church history occurred here. One significant 
                doctrine that was revealed to the prophet Joseph was the doctrine of proxy ordinance work. At the time, all 
                that was revealed was the doctrine of baptisms for the dead (other proxy ordinances like endowments and 
                sealings were not performed until after the Saints traveled to Utah).<br><br>Another significant 
                happening in the Church in Nauvoo was the organization of the Relief Society, then known as the Nauvoo 
                Female Relief Society. Joseph Smith was involved in its organization and "turned a key", meaning he 
                exercised his priesthood keys and organized the Relief Society as an essential organization in the restored 
                Church. Members of the Relief Society voted that Emma Smith be made their first President, and they held 
                several meetings during their time in Nauvoo. Later, after the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young feared 
                that Emma, who had struggled mightily with the revealed practice of plural marriage, might incite the 
                members of the Relief Society against him and other Church leaders, so the Relief Society was discontinued 
                for a time.<br><br>Before the prophet's martydrom, he taught and revealed critical doctrines and ordinances. 
                One example is when he spoke at the funeral of King Follett about the true nature of God. Here, the prophet 
                taught that God was once as man is, and that man can eventually become as God. The prophet also gave a 
                relatively small group of Saints a presentation of the endowment that is more similar to what today's Latter-day 
                Saints know it as than the endowment given in Kirtland. In this, the prophet taught the company the keys, signs, 
                and tokens of the priesthood. Some in the company recognized that this presentation was similar to rites 
                performed in Masonic lodges (more on this can be learned at the Church's article below).
