            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In 1820, a young boy named Joseph Smith was becoming increasingly concerned about the salvation of his
                soul. Questions about
                religion were not uncommon for someone in his time and place to have. Many events had led to Joseph's
                questions, including
                the Second Great Awakening. This was a time of religious revival in the United States. Preachers of
                various religious
                sects travelled around the country seeking converts. Joseph lived in western New York, an area that
                became known as the
                burned over district because there were so many preachers who had held meetings there. Later, Joseph
                described how
                he became increasingly concerned with the topic of religion, and sought to join a church and have
                spiritual experiences
                like he had heard others describe. This culminated in Joseph Smith seeking answers - he turned to the
                Bible and eventually
                to God in prayer. After travelling to what is now called the Sacred Grove, Joseph prayed to God and was
                visited by
                God the Father and Jesus Christ. <br><br> What may not be known by many who have already heard of Joseph
                Smith's First
                Vision is that there are four primary accounts of it. They are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1832 account - originally recorded in Joseph's journal/unpublished autobiography.</li>
                <li>1835 account - a transcript from Joseph telling a traveller to Kirtland about the vision.</li>
                <li>1838 account - most well-known account by modern Latter-day Saints, written as part of the History
                    of the Church.</li>
                <li>1842 account - also known as the Wentworth letter, written to John Wentworth, an editor of a
                    newspaper in Illinois.</li>
            </ul>
