            <hr>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Joseph Smith was still a young boy when he was visited by Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, however They
                alluded to the fact that They had a work for him to do. The first thing Joseph was to do in the
                beginnings
                of the restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was find and translate a record of an
                ancient people who lived in the Americas. These people had the gospel of Jesus Christ revealed to them
                through prophets and heavenly manifestations. They were even visited by Jesus Christ after his
                crucifixion
                and resurrection. The Lord appeared to be appeasing one of Joseph Smith's concerns about the
                impossibility
                of proving the truthfulness of a church by an appeal to the Bible. With the Bible and the Book of
                Mormon,
                the Lord was able to bring back truths that had been lost through centuries of confoundment. <br><br> On
                the 21st of
                September, 1823, as he was retiring to bed, the young Joseph Smith was visited by an ancient prophet who
                had written
                part of the record that would become the Book of Mormon named Moroni. Moroni taught Joseph that God had
                a work for
                him to do, and instructed him about how he was to find and translate the record. However, Joseph still
                had much to learn
                before he was prepared to handle the record. Due to the poverty his family experienced, the lure of
                using an ancient
                record recorded on gold plates to help his family financially was powerful. It was four years after
                Moroni first visited
                Joseph that he was finally prepared to obtain the record. <br><br> Many members of the Church may be
                unaware of some
                of the specifics on how the Book of Mormon was translated. Most well known is that Joseph Smith used
                interpreters called
                the Urim and Thummim to look into to see translated English text. Not as well known is that, over time,
                it became
                convenient for Joseph to use a seer stone that he had found many years earlier. He would place this
                stone in a hat
                to block out outstide light, and then translated English text would appear to him, and he could dictate
                the translation
                to a scribe in the same room. Testimonies of how this translation process occurred abound from those who
                acted as
                scribe, and yet Joseph remained hesitant to reveal the specifics of translation, stating simply that it
                was done
                by the gift and power of God and that the Lord never intended for the world to know the specifics of the
                Book of Mormon's
                translation.
